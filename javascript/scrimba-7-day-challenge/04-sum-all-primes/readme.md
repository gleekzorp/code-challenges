### Some Help With Prime Numbers
> Information from http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.prime.num.html

What is a prime number?  How can you find prime numbers?  What's the 'Sieve of Eratosthenes'?  How can you decide if a number is prime?  What's the largest known prime?

A prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive integer factors, 1 and itself. For example, if we list the factors of 28, we have 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. That's six factors. If we list the factors of 29, we only have 1 and 29. That's two factors. So we say that 29 is a prime number, but 28 isn't.

Another way of saying this is that a prime number is a positive integer that is not the product of two smaller positive integers.

Note that the definition of a prime number doesn't allow 1 to be a prime number: 1 only has one factor, namely 1. Prime numbers have exactly two factors, not "at most two" or anything like that. When a number has more than two factors it is called a composite number.

### Here are the first few prime numbers:
> 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, etc.
